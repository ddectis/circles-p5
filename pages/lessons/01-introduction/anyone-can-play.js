                            What is Play? I like to say that Play a way to manifest our imagination into the world through joyful acts of self-expression.

                            When, as a child, you found a stick at the park, maybe your pretended it was a magic wand to fight the goblins you imagined darting between the trees. Your imagination created fun and nobody had to tell you how to do it. You weren't following a script and the only rules were whatever sounded good in your head.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Meanwhile, the verb for making music is -- and it's no
                            coincidence -- Play. I believe that music can be a joyful form of self-expression for everybody. The purpose of this program is to foster your ability to Play music in that child-like sense.

                            Together, we're going to build a mental framework to think in the language of music. We will add musical concepts layer by layer. 
                            We will cultivate your ability to manifest your musical
                            imagination into the world through joyful acts of self-expression. In other words, you'll learn to Play.

                            This course will present the fundamentals of music theory in a fun  and practical way. You will apply these principals toward
                            building your own system to approach playing music. We'll learn about how to talk about music, how to analyze and emulate your favorite songs, how to improvise, how to jam.

                            I feel as though the term <b>Music Theory</b> can be offputting or intimidating to newcomers. Theory? That sounds complicated! Well, I've got some good news for you: music theory is not about rules! In this program we will seek to help you <b>describe</b> what you like in music so that you can play the things you like to play.
                            <br/><br/>
                            What we're not going to do in this course is give you a bunch of rules you need to follow. No, music is not about rules. Instead, we're going to follow the same rules we all followed when we played as children: it has to sound good.
