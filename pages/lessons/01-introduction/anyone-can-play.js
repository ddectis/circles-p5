                            When we were children, we played. We manifested our imagination into the world through joyful acts 
                            of self-expression. We called it Play. Meanwhile, the verb for making music is -- and it's no 
                            coincidence -- also Play.
                            The purpose of this program is to foster your ability to Play music in that child-like sense.
